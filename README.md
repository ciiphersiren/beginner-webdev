# 🌐 Web Development Journey

Welcome to my Web Development Journey repository! This is where I document my progress and projects as I dive into the world of web development. Let's build something amazing together! 🚀

## Practices

1. **👋 Hello World**
   - File: [hello.html](./hello.html)
   - Description: My very first HTML file, displaying a simple "Hello, World!" message. A small step into the vast universe of web development.

2. **📄 Basic Elements**
   - File: [basic-elements.html](./basic-elements.html)
   - Description: An HTML file showcasing basic HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. It's the foundation of my learning journey.
